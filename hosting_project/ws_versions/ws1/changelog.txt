### webSPELL Society Edition 4.2.1a ( 2009-07-30 ) rev.3398

As this is the very first final release of the Society Edition there isn't much of a changelog.

For those who are wondering about the high version number for an initial relase: it reflects the 
version numbering of the regular E-Sports webSPELL version as all the bugfixes of the regular
webSPELL 4.2.1a - as far as they are from any concern to the files of the Society Edition - have
been ported to the Society Edition too.

For those who want to know which changes have been made to each files compared to the regular 
webSPELL version... just use a diff tool of your choice. Nearly every single file has been 
changed including very massive changes. Also a lot of new files have been added to implement
the additional features of the Society Edition.
